Game Instructions:
- Survival:
You gain points by surviving as long as possible. If you get hit by a monster, you lose hp. If you
lose all of your hp, you die and the game ends.
- Maze
You must make it to the end of the maze without hitting a wall. Completing each maze accumulates your
score. If you hit a wall, you die and the game is over.
- Guessing Game
There are a number of monsters moving on the screen and you must correctly guess the number of monsters
to accumulate xp.

Things you should know:
- some of our phase 2 progress was pushed into phase 1
- this README.txt was "pushed" into the project directory before the deadline, but there must have
been an error because it had disappeared from the directory.
